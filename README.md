## 🌟 Features

This program outputs the Data of 10 NPC's. It saves time by already having a list of values
which the the program chooses by random. It can be useful when trying to generate
random people or random data that you might need for other things.

## 📜 Overview

The purpose of this program is to create a Non-Playable Character generator for an open-world video game.
My goal was to develop a program which produces 10 unique characters with different attributes. My 
program firsts imports a library called random which allows you to generate random numbers in python.
I then create a list of values which consist of the attributes of the 10 NPCs. After that, I created
a for loop which asked for the name of the NPC, stored it in a variable, generated a random choice
from the list, ages, stored it into a variable, generated a random choice from the list, heights, 
stored it into a variable.generated a random choice from the list, eyecolors, stored it into a variable,
and choosed a random number between 1 and 10000 which was stored as the power level of the NPC. This for
loop repeated 10 times, gathering data of 10 NPCs. I then added all this data to a list called, npc. Lastly,
I printed all of this data out of the NPC attributes in a clear format. The motivation behind creating this
program was for a school project. The scenario was where I had to create an NPC generator for an open-world
video game. The game developers already designed the main characters, but needed an algorithm to create
diverse NPCs. My goal was to produce at least 10 of these NPCs.
